# UBC course webscraper
Node.js Puppeteer web scraper built for the ubc course listing website

Currently: saves data to a json file with each course as its own json object

The purpose of creating this was to provide a model of how to scrape the UBC course listing website at each level (so others can adapt it efficiently and use it for their own purposes ðŸ˜‰)

I originally had attempted to do the html navigation with Python's Selenium library, but later found that the node.js Puppeteer library is much better for these purposes!

** do NOT run this, it takes up a lot of memory; I am currently working on changing it to write to a csv which will likely take less memory space !! The script can be used/copied for personal use though. I am not endorsing using this for any sort of automated enrollment as I'm pretty sure that is extremely not allowed!!!! However...if someone wanted to use my code for that, that's none of my business.
